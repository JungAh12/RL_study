Value function approximation
Silver의 강의는 1~5 강과 6~10강으로 나뉜다고 생각할 수 있다.

### 1. Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning

  Reinforcement learning can be used to solve large problems, e.g.
    Backgammon  : 10^20 states
    Computer Go : 10^170 states
    Helicopter  : continous state space

#### Value Function Approximation

  So far we have represented value function by a lookup table
    Every state s has an entry V(s)
    Or overy state-action pair s,a has an engry Q(s,a)

  Problem with large MDPs:
    There are too many states and/or actions to store in memory
    It is too slow to learn the value of each state individually

  Solution for large MDPs:
    Estimate value function with function approximation
         v_hat(s,w) ~~ v_pi(s)
      or q_hat(s,a,w) ~~ q_pi(s,a)

    Generalise from seen states to unseen states
    Update parameter w using MC or TD learning
